# RAREval-data-processing

This repository provides the official code for the data preprocessing procedures introduced in our paper:  
**Do Reviews Matter for Recommendations in the Era of Large Language Models?**

RAREval is a standardized evaluation framework designed to assess the robustness and sensitivity of review-aware recommender systems under varying textual conditions, including:

- **No-Review**: Removes all textual reviews  
- **Reduction**: Randomly removes a portion of review texts (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)  
- **Distortion**: Reassigns review texts among user-item pairs (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)  
- **Data Sparsity**: Applies k-core filtering and splits into train/valid/test  
- **Cold-Start**: Evaluates performance across user groups with 1â€“10 historical interactions (no preprocessing required)

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

You need to prepare the following datasets before running RAREval.

ðŸ”— Download from: [https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon/links.html](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon/links.html)  

Please download both the **5-core** and **raw** versions (no k-core filtering) for the following 8 domains:

| Dataset                  | Example Filename                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
