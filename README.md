# RAREval-data-processing
This repository provides the official code for the data preprocessing procedures introduced in our paper:
**Do Reviews Matter for Recommendations in the Era of Large Language Models?**


RAREval is a standardized evaluation framework designed to assess the robustness and sensitivity of review-aware recommender systems under varying textual conditions, including:
- **No-Review**: Removes all textual reviews  
- **Reduction**: Randomly removes a portion of reviewText (0%ï¼Œ25%, 50%, 75%ï¼Œ100%)  
- **Distortion**: Reassigns reviewText among user-item pairs (0%ï¼Œ25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)  
- **Data Sparsity**: Applies k-core filtering and splits into train/valid/test
- **Cold-Start**: Evaluates performance across user groups with 1â€“10 historical interactions (no preprocessing required)
## Requirements
